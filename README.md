Smart box using RPi to control temperature and in general ... surveillance
We have two scripts:
1. To play with the relay itself
2. To read and write data within the common storage. This will enfore in the end:
    a. graphics
    b. Show all temperatures. Create a menu with all possible graphics, for today, for outside etc...
    c. We need to add a login to it
    This could be done within Express or another web framework
